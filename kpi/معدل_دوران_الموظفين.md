# معدل دوران الموظفين


To calculate employee turnover rate, follow these steps:

- Determine the number of employees who left the company during the time period you are measuring.
- Divide this number by the average number of employees during the same time period.
- Multiply this number by 100 to get the turnover rate as a percentage.
For example, if 10 employees left the company in a year and the average number of employees during that year was 100, the turnover rate would be 10%.

Here is the formula:

Employee turnover rate = (Number of employees who left during the time period / Average number of employees during the time period) * 100%

Example:
``````
Number of employees who left during the year = 10
Average number of employees during the year = 100

Employee turnover rate = (10 / 100) * 100% = 10%
