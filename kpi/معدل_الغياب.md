# طريقة إحتساب معدل الغياب

To calculate absenteeism rate, follow these steps:

Determine the number of absences during the time period you are measuring.
Divide this number by the total number of scheduled workdays during the same time period.
Multiply this number by 100 to get the absenteeism rate as a percentage.
Here is the formula:

``````
Absenteeism rate = (Number of absences / Total number of scheduled workdays) * 100%
``````

Example:
``````
Number of absences = 10
Total number of scheduled workdays = 200

Absenteeism rate = (10 / 200) * 100% = 5%
``````

Absenteeism rate is a useful metric for tracking how often employees are absent from work and for identifying areas where improvement is needed. By tracking absenteeism rate, companies can improve their employee attendance and reduce the costs associated with absenteeism.
