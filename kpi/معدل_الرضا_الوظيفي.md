# طريقة إحتساب معدل الرضا الوظيفي


Employee engagement score (EES) is a metric that measures how motivated, committed, and satisfied employees are with their work. It is typically measured through employee engagement surveys, which ask employees to rate their satisfaction with various aspects of their job, such as their manager, their workload, and their opportunities for growth and development.

To calculate EES, you can use the following formula:

``````
EES = (Average score of all employees / Highest possible score) * 100
``````

The highest possible score will vary depending on the survey you use, but it is typically 5 or 7 points per question.

For example, if you use a 5-point survey and the average score of all employees is 4.2, the EES would be 84%.

EES is a valuable metric for tracking employee morale and identifying areas where improvement is needed. By tracking EES over time, you can see how your employees are feeling about their work and make changes to improve their engagement.
