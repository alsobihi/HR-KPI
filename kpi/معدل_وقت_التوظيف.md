#  طريقة حساب معدل وقت التوظيف
To calculate time to hire, you need to know the following two dates:

The date the job was posted
The date the new hire accepted the job offer
Once you have these two dates, you can calculate time to hire by subtracting the first date from the second date. The result will be the number of days it took to hire the new employee.

For example, if a job was posted on January 1st and the new hire accepted the job offer on February 15th, the time to hire would be 46 days.

Here is the formula:

``````
Time to hire = Date new hire accepted job offer - Date job was posted
``````
Example:
``````
Date new hire accepted job offer = February 15th
Date job was posted = January 1st

Time to hire = February 15th - January 1st = 46 days
``````
Time to hire is a useful metric for tracking how long it takes to fill open positions and for identifying areas where the recruitment process can be improved. By tracking time to hire, companies can reduce the time it takes to fill open positions and get their new hires on board more quickly.
