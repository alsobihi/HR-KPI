# طريقة حساب معدل تكلفة التوظيف

To calculate cost per hire, you need to know the total cost of hiring a new employee. This includes the cost of advertising, recruiting, and onboarding. Once you have this number, you can divide it by the number of new hires to get the cost per hire.

Here is the formula:

Cost per hire = Total cost of hiring new employees / Number of new hires

Example:

Total cost of hiring new employees = $100,000
Number of new hires = 10

Cost per hire = $100,000 / 10 = $10,000
Cost per hire is a useful metric for tracking how much it costs to hire a new employee and for identifying areas where costs can be reduced. By tracking cost per hire, companies can improve their hiring efficiency and save money.
